# Asset Management - the overarching framework

The International Standard ISO 55000, Asset management - Overview, principles and terminology (2014) defines an asset as an ‘item, thing or entity that has potential or actual value to an organization’ and asset management as the ‘coordinated activity of an organization to realise value from assets’.

Asset management (AM) is a whole of organisation approach to managing assets and encompasses much more that just the maintenance of physical
equipment, or the maximising of yield from a financial portfolio. AM encompasses all asset types, tangible and intangible, individual components or complex systems, and all activities involved in the asset’s life cycle.

The AM community professional bodies have identified 39 areas of subject areas in AM grouped as follows: 1) Strategy and Planning, 2) AM Decision making, 3) Lifecycle delivery, 4) Asset information, 5) Organisation and people, 6) Risk and review. Decisions in all of these areas can be enhanced by use of data and models to help managers understand what has happened historically, explore scenarios for the future and consider, in a coherent way, the effect of uncertainties on outcomes. 

## Our interest

Our interest in this course is specifically on data collected by 1)  maintenance technicians and planners in the course of work,  and by 2) reliability and mainteannce engineers as they develop and review asset maintenance strategies and work to manage the cost and reliability of the assets they are responsible for.

This data is primarily drawn from the following sources
* Computerised maintenance management system: a relational data base containing, for example, maintenance records, bills of materials, parts and costs data.
* FMEA and RCM records: Failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) and Reliability-centred maintenance (RCM) records, usually captured in Excel spreadsheets
* RCA or warranty records: Root cause analysis investigations, captured in Excel spreadsheets or propietary software
