# Day 2 Maintenance Work Management

## How to develop maintenance strategy

Decisions on what maintenance to do (and when) on an asset is determined by asset criticality and failure behaviour. Structured processes for this include such as Reliability-centred Maintenance (RCM) and Preventative Maintenance Optimisation (PMO). 

The RCM process involves a Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) followed by the use of a decision-tree process to identify a suitable maintnance activity type for each high ranking failure mode.
